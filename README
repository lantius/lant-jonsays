TO INSTALL

If you would like to record the impressions to MySQL, first run the 
query in createDB.sql, then modify conn.php to match your db info.
If you do not plan to record to MySQL, these will be ignored.

Modify the info in the first 16 or so lines of showimg.php to match 
your image and preferences. The script should take any number of lines 
provided in the query string, and you can also provide a defualt value.
